# Metrics
Metrics are defined by calculations based on performance counters. 
A prevalent metric is "Cycles per Instruction" (CPI), which gauges efficiency by calculating how many CPU cycles are needed per instructionâ€”the lower the number, the better. 
To compute this metric, the "instructions" and "cycles" counters are essential.

The library comes pre-equipped with several metrics that can be utilized in the same way as counters. 
Simply add the metric names to the `perf::EventCounter` instance to use them:
```
cycles-per-instruction
cache-hit-ratio
dTLB-miss-ratio
iTLB-miss-ratio
L1-data-miss-ratio
```

**Attention**: Metrics will not work with sampling.

## Recording metrics
You can add metrics like counters.
```cpp
#include <perfcpp/event_counter.h>
auto counter_definitions = perf::CounterDefinition{};
auto event_counter = perf::EventCounter{counter_definitions};

event_counter.add({"cycles-per-instruction"});
```

## Defining specific metrics
However, the most intriguing metrics depend on the counters that are available on specific hardware. 
You can use the `perf::Metric` interface to develop your own metrics, tailored to the unique performance counters of your system:

```cpp
#include <perfcpp/metric.h>
class StallsPerCacheMiss final : public perf::Metric
{
public:
    /// Set up a name, can be overriden by the counter definition when adding.
    [[nodiscard]] std::string name() const override 
    {
        return "stalls-per-cache-miss"; 
    }
    
    /// List of counters that need to be measured to calculate this metric.
    [[nodiscard]] std::vector<std::string> required_counter_names() const 
    { 
        return {"stalls", "cache-misses"}; 
    }
    
    /// Calculate the metric.
    [[nodiscard]] std::optional<double> calculate(const CounterResult& result) const
    {
        const auto stalls = result.get("stalls");
        const auto cache_misses = result.get("cache-misses");

        if (stalls.has_value() && cache_misses.has_value())
        {
            return stalls.value() / cache_misses.value();
        }

        return std::nullopt;
    }
};
```

### Measure the new metric
Upon implementation, the metric must be added to the counter definition instance:
```cpp
auto counter_definitions = perf::CounterDefinition{};
counter_definitions.add(std::make_unique<StallsPerCacheMiss>());

/// You can also override the name of the metric
counter_definitions.add("SPCM", std::make_unique<StallsPerCacheMiss>());
```

Then, it can be added to the `perf::EventCounter`-instance:
```cpp
event_counter.add("stalls-per-cache-miss");

/// Or, in case you have overriden the name:
event_counter.add("SPCM");
```
